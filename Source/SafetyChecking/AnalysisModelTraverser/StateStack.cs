	///   Represents a stack of <see cref="AnalysisModel" /> states that have yet to be checked.

	/// <remarks>
	///   When enumerating all states of a model in a depth-first fashion, we have to store the next states (that are computed all
	///   at once) somewhere while also being able to generate the counter example. When check a new state, a new frame is allocated
	///   on the stack and all unknown successor states are stored in that frame. We then take the topmost state, compute its
	///   successor states, and so on. When a formula violation is detected, the counter example consists of the last states of each
	///   frame on the stack. When a frame has been fully enumerated without detecting a formula violation, the stack frame is
	///   removed, the topmost state of the topmost frame is removed, and the new topmost state is checked.
